# hello-world
This is my first repository. I've named it in the traditional manner, as well as that prescribed by the tutorial, but I must admit refactored-broccoli is an excellent suggestion. Makes me think of 3D fractal renders resembling romanesco broccoli.

The hello-world tutorial states that I should edit this including "a bit about [my]self." Yet it seems that I already did a whole bit when I first made this readme file. I'd hate to be redundant.

I can't believe Coursera wasted so much of my time listening to all this in a robot voice when they're just going to have you do the GitHub guide anyway.
